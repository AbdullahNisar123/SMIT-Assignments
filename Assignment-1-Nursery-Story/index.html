    <h1>The Brave Little Rabbit</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a <em>quiet</em> forest, there was a little rabbit named <dfn>Remy</dfn>. Remy was <strong>very brave</strong>, even though he was the smallest rabbit in the forest.</p>

    <p>One day, while Remy was hopping through the woods, he noticed something <del>strange</del> <ins>shiny</ins> under a tree. It was a <abbr title="Magic Key">M. Key</abbr>. He knew he had to take it to the wise old owl, <cite>Professor Hoot</cite>.</p>

    <h2>The Adventure Begins</h2>
    <p>Remy decided to go on an adventure. <q>The forest can be scary,</q> he thought, <q>but I can do this!</q></p>
    <p>He hopped past tall trees and <i>rustling</i> bushes until he came across a big river. <br> He couldn't swim, but he found a <strong>strong</strong> branch to use as a bridge.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>        "Bravery isn't about being fearless," said Professor Hoot. "It's about doing what's right even when you're scared."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>With the key in hand, Remy returned to the forest, feeling proud. The animals cheered for him, and from that day on, he was known as the <sup>1st</sup> bravest rabbit in the forest!</p>
